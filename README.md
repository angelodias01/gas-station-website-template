# EcoFuel Station Website Template

## Project Overview

The EcoFuel Station template is a responsive, single-page website designed specifically for the energy and automotive service sector. It serves as a digital landing page for gas stations, petrol bunkers, and electric vehicle charging hubs.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a professional, lightweight, and fast-loading web presence that communicates essential information—such as fuel types, pricing availability, location, and amenities—to customers on any device.

## Key Features

### Responsive Interface
The layout is built with a "mobile-first" approach. It automatically adjusts its structure to look optimal on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and large desktop screens.

### Service Availability Dashboard
A central feature of the design is the grid layout that displays the status of various fuel types (Unleaded 95, Unleaded 98, Diesel, LPG) and EV Charging stations. This allows business owners to visually indicate which pumps are online or under maintenance.

### Integrated Mapping
The footer includes an embedded map powered by OpenStreetMap. This provides customers with immediate location context without requiring the user to leave the website or the developer to manage complex API keys.

### Lightweight Performance
The project relies on internal SVG graphics for visual elements rather than heavy external image files. This ensures the website loads almost instantly, even on slower mobile network connections.

## Technology Stack

### HTML5
Used for the structural hierarchy and semantic organization of the content.

### CSS3
Handles the visual styling, color themes, and responsive grid layouts.

### JavaScript
Manages user interactivity, specifically the mobile navigation menu and smooth scrolling effects.

## How to Use the Project

Since this is a static website template, it does not require a complex installation process, database setup, or backend server environment.

1.  **Download:** Download the project files to your local computer.
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the folder if necessary.
3.  **Launch:** Locate the main file (index.html) and open it using any standard web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Customization Guide

### Editing Content
All text information, including the company name, address, phone numbers, and customer reviews, is contained directly within the main HTML file. You can modify this text using any text editor.

### Changing the Color Scheme
The visual theme is managed through a central configuration in the CSS file. By modifying the "root variables" at the top of the stylesheet, you can instantly change the primary brand colors across the entire website to match your specific logo or branding.

### Replacing Images
While the template includes a custom code-based illustration, standard photographs can be replaced by updating the source links in the HTML file to point to your own image files.
